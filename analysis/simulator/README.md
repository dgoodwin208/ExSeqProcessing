# Creating simulated ExSeq Data

Go to runSimulatorRound.m to run the basic script of simulating data, saving it to disk, then running the ExSeqProcessing pipeline.

It requires both the simulator params (controlled by loadSimParams.m) and the experiment params (loadParameters.m) to be set appropriately. 

For your first run through, the most likely cause of issues is simply the folders that the loadParameters.m file points to.
